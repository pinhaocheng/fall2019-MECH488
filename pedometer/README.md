## LAB ASSIGNMENT NO 6

## Using your cell phone as a measurement device

### Introduction

Smartphones are becoming more sophisticated every day. On some levels our phones are more advanced than our laptops and desktop computers. Many spartphones have imbedded sensors including accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, GPS, light sensors, and thermometers, not to mention the camera, microphone, and lights.

A smartphone can be a powerful tool for an engineer. Mobile apps are available that use built-in sensors to take measurements using the camera, turn your phone into an inclinometer, measure lighting in a room, track you position, measure accelerations, and the list goes on.

### Task

Your task in the assignment is to create a pedometer using a smartphoneâ€™s accelerometer. Download an app that allows you to export acceleration data.
